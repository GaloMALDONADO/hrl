     pr2_clutter_helper
     
     Helpful short functions for trapping an image, pointcloud,
       transforms from tf, camera_info from the PR2.
     Used to grab data for the package "gt-ros-pkg/hrl/clutter_segmentation"
       
     Works on bagged data as well (if --clock is published).
     
     Main source file: acquire_pr2_data.py
     
     This collects and formats everythin needed by clutter_svm_segmentation.
     Also has code to map camera coloring into pointcloud and republish
        for easy viewing in ROS (Active if run stand-alone).
     
     Also helpful launch files.
