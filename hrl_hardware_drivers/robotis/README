This code has been tested for the following servos:
Robotis Dynamixel RX-28 and RX-64.

One place to purchase the servos is

How to run the code:

cd bin

1. ./robotis_servo -h   # this will print out the command line params that the code accepts.

2. ./robotis_servo -d /dev/ttyUSB0 --ang=30 --id=1  # moves a servo with id 1 connected to ttyUSB0 to angle 30 degrees.
