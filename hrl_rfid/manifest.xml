    UHF RFID (Ultra-High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification)
    reader based on ThingMagic Mercury5e (M5e) and Mercury5e-Compact
    (M5e-C) modules.  ThingMagic's highly-capable Gen2 UHF RFID
    modules interact with low-cost "smart labels" (tags) at distances
    up to 6 meters depending on choice of antennas (distances over 100
    meters possible using highly-directive antennas!) even without
    line-of-sight visibility, as RF penetrates most non-conducting
    materials.  The reader can simultaneously query for hundreds of
    tags in the environment at once or query for presence / absence of
    a individual tag among a sea of others.  A stand-alone Python
    library is provided as well as ROS wrappers.
