This package is a modification of explore_wg, which is an overlay (?)
of the bosch frontier exploration ("explore" in bosch-ros-pkg).  

The following modifications have either been made or will be shortly:

-- ROS Service calls for particular status checks (eg. done searching)

-- Actionlib capabilities for nice Smach interfacing.

-- Re-settable calls to the explore action with differing exploration
   radii.
