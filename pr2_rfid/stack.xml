  <description brief="pr2_rfid">This stack contains code for robot behaviors and radio frequency perception techniques that enable a PR2 (modified with articulated patch antennas) to efficiently discover, locate, and interact with long-range (UHF) RFID tags applied to locations, objects, and people of interest.  Sample capabilities include: estimating the bearing toward a tag, RFID servoing, and RFID search.  These techniques form the foundation of Travis Deyle's PhD thesis; we also demonstrated sample applications such as medication delivery, sensor fusion, and RFID search in home environments.</description>
