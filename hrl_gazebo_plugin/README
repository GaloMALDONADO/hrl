1. Install gazebo requirements 
2. Install new gazebo 1.3~1.4.6

5. Install pr2_controller_configuration_gazebo
   (which includes pr2sim controller yaml files)

# Description
1. You can find those from gazebosim website.
2. Don't miss the 'not found libraries' when you do cmake
   But, you can skip 'player' library
3. You can find it from gazebosim website. 
   Or open gazebo and click model you want. Then, it will automatically install.
4. Compile following 'ros enabled plugin' instruction on gazebosim website.  
5. To run conventional controller lightly, I removed something. 
   If you want to use arm and wheel?, in that case just use it.
